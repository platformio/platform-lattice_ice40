  "description": "The iCE40 family of ultra-low power, non-volatile FPGAs has five devices with densities ranging from 384 to 7680 Look-Up Tables (LUTs). In addition to LUT-based,low-cost programmable logic, these devices feature Embedded Block RAM (EBR), Non-volatile Configuration Memory (NVCM) and Phase Locked Loops (PLLs). These features allow the devices to be used in low-cost, high-volume consumer and system applications.",
